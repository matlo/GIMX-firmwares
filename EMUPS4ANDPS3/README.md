GIMX Firmware for PS3 AND PS4
====
WARNING:This is still untested! Will test as soon as possible(within a week from the commit of this file.)

This is a hybrid firmware for GIMX both working on PS3 and PS4.

It is still in early stages, i simply merged the two sources together.

Future updates include reusing functions instead of just copypasta.

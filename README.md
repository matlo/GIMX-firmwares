GIMX Firmware 
====
WARNING:The hybrid firmwares are still untested! Will test as soon as possible(within a week from the commit of this file.)
The current hybrids are:
EMUPS4ANDPS4

-This project has the intent of merging as most firmwares as possible into a single one. 

-It is still in early stages, i simply merged the two sources for PS4 and PS3 together.

-Future updates include reusing functions instead of just copypasta and basic switching.

-ATTENTION: due to overhead of firmwares it is possible that this merged firmware will be a bit SLOWER than the original single file.
 I have not tested it yet. (Slow as in processing the input and sending it to the console

Thanks to the original author: @matlo for this wonderful project

Original Readme copypasted from the GIMX software(not firmware) as follows:

GIMX
====

GIMX stands for `Game Input MultipleXer` or `Game Input MatriX`.  
The purpose of this software is to control a video game console with a computer (e.g. a PC or a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)).  
It works with the PS3, the Xbox 360, the PS4 and the Xbox One.  
It operates:  
¤ over bluetooth: works with Linux (PS3, PS4) only. A compatible bluetooth dongle is required.  
¤ over usb: works with Linux and Windows (PS3, PS4, 360, XOne). A USB adapter is required.  
The application gets data from the peripherals (mice, keyboards and joysticks) and sends controls to the console over bluetooth or usb.  
Other controls such as gesture or voice are possible through the use of external software that emulate peripherals.
